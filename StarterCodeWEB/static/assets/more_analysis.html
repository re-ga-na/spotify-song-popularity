                  <h5>What does it take to have a popular song on Spotify? </h5>
                  <p class="card-text">This is, quite literally, the million-dollar question.
                    <br></br>
                    This project has the objective to predict a song’s Spotify popularity based on audio features from the Spotify database and song popularity measured by the number of followers.
                    We used regression and classification models to answer some of these questions:
                    <ul>
                      <li>What does it take to get a popular song on Spotify? </li>
                      <li>Can a song's features predict its popularity on Spotify?</li>
                    </ul>
                     
                     From the Spotify database API, a ~45,000 songs and artist were analyzed from different genres. The dataset comes from Million Song Database (2008-2010) and Kaggle Datasets. There were three different calls to the API to get artist, audio and track features.
                     After using Python and some data wrangling techniques, we created data frame that was used to do some exploratory data analysis. Our Target Variable is Popularity and the Independent Variables are: Acousticness, Danceability, Duration, Energy, Instrumentalness, Key, Liveness, Loudness, Mode, Speechiness, Tempo, Valence and Followers.
                     <br></br>
                     
                     <!-- <div class="card-deck">
                      <div class="col-sm-6">
                        <div class="card">
                          <div class="card-body"> -->
                            <h5><bold>Data and Analysis</bold></h5>
                              Looking at the distributions of each feature, there is no clear correlation between the popularity of a song, and other features. The only features that show some correlation are Loudness, Acousticness Energy and Followers.
                              <br></br>

                              <br></br>
                              To get a better sense of how the features are correlated, we created different plots. The most significant one is the one is Energy vs. Loudness by Acousticness, While other plots, as you notice from the image below, are not really meaningful.

                              <br></br>
                              To improve the understanding of the overall distribution of these features, we created different visualizations as follows.
                              <img class="rounded float-left" alt= "Pair Plots" width='50%' height='50%' src="../images/pair_plots.png">
                              <br></br>
                              Followers vs. popularity – the more popular the song, the more followers it has. 
                              <img class="rounded float-left" alt= "Box Plot Followers" width='50%' height='50%' src="../images/box_plot_followers.png">
                              <br></br>
                              On the other hand, we would expect, the danceability of the song to have a correlation to its popularity, but it is not happening.

                              Instrumentaliness vs. popularity, instead, shows that the less instrumental the song is, the more popular it becomes.

                          Our target variable is popularity, which has a value from 0 to 100, with 100 being the most popular. Spotify's "Popularity" Score is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.

                          We used classification algorithms to predict whether a song will be popular or not. We used historical data to train the model and built a prediction model by regression. The 3 models we used are: Linesr Regression, OLS Regression and Classification Model.
