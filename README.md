### Final Project - Prediction of popularity: explaining song popularity from Spotify data

This project has the objective of displaying the relationship between song data - audio features from the Spotify database - and song popularity measured by the number of streams a song has on Spotify.

From the Spotify database API, a 12,000 songs were analyzed from different genres. By regression, a prediction
model was built. 

We can conclude that our results suggest that audio features from Spotify have little to moderate impact in predicting song popularity.
